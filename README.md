# gemBlog

A small, really basic blogging system for hosting on Gemini protocol.

Can list files from a fixed folder, based on file modify date.

I made it just as a proof of concept for myself, but maybe someone find it useful. I think I'm gonna use it on my own capsule.

This code was made in a few hours, using nano in a terminal and the code itself isn't the cleanest and performance optimized...

Anyway.

## Configuration

Edit config.py. Here, you can setup the root directory of your post gmi files. Others are labels.

## Usage
Right now, it is written with Jetforce (https://github.com/michael-lazar/jetforce) in mind. Just put it to your cgi-bin folder and make it executable.
